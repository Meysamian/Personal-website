            I have a strong passion for the environment and used to engage in mountain climbing. However, since coming to Britain, I've shifted more towards hiking. I find them to be both a means of challenging myself and an opportunity for solitude, allowing for reflection and concentration.

            Over the past two decades, my interests have been primarily focused on Cinema, Philosophy, Psychology, and Literature. However, in recent years, I came to the realisation that a comprehensive understanding of the world requires a solid grasp of History.
            As a result, History has become an integral addition to my list of passions.
